# Emotion-Evaluator
This is our project of HackSC 2019. The Web App could evaluate speaker's emotion by what they are saying.There are five levels, including Painful, Sad,Normal, Happy, Excited. All of them are expressed by funny emojis.

## Inspiration
Our team focuses on web development and machine learning technology. We are really interested in combining these technologies together to make some interesting products which is our inspiration to make this funny web app.

## What it does
This web app can understand people's emotion through listening their speech. We set 5 different level emotions which expressed by 5 different funny emojis. When people say a word it will translate the speech into text and show the corresponding emoji.

## How we built it
We used the Google Cloud machining learning APIs to accomplish the AI function including NLP and Speech to Text task. We combined them together to translate speech to text and do the sentiment analysis. Since it's a web app, front end technology is the most important part. We implemented Flask combing with Bootstrap, HTML, CSS to design the web page and build the connection between frontend and backend.

## Challenges we ran into
How to synchronize APIs with web reaction; How to use GCP to deploy app and do web develop are challenges we ran into.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We think it's an interesting app!

## What we learned
We've learned how to use Google API and how to combine them to do web development. We also learned how to use GCP to develop products which gave us a wonderful experience.

## What's next for Emotion Judgement by NLP
We want to enrich functions like adding animation and facial recognition to help app do more accurate judgements.
